# PokemonGo-Desktop
An unofficial desktop version of the mobile game using unity. Designed to be close to the original game however slightly modified to allow better desktop support, such as WASD movement.

Slow Progress: This project is making slow progress as I have code I am wanting to test however the pokemon servers are frequently offline. Feel free to join my slack (https://error22.herokuapp.com/) to contact me!

##Target platforms
Using unity allows the project to be exported to numerous devices, however some devices require extra consideration when designing support them, so a select few platforms are being mainly focused upon.
- Windows
- Linux
- Web (Using WebGL)

##Features
- [x] PTC Login
- [ ] Google Login
- [ ] Google maps
- [ ] Nearby Pokemon
- [ ] WASD support
- [ ] Map (with teleport and viewing past local area, can be disabled if you think it's cheating)
- [ ] Pokemon catching
- [ ] All Pokemon's 
- [ ] Pokestops
- [ ] Gyms

Some aspects of this program may not be optimal, such as 2d graphics however this is due to the limited supply of assets freely available. Making the program 3D is of course on our wish list, however isn't possible without modellers.
